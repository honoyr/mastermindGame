  <h1>Mastermind</h1>
  <p>The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the computer (the
    code-maker).</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>1. At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a pattern of different numbers. You need to <strong>guess
    the combination of numbers</strong></p>
  <p>2. Type your guess numbers into the input form and press <strong>check</strong></p>
  <app-input-form></app-input-form>
  <h3>"Attempt 10"</h3>
  <p> 3.You will have limited number of attempts to guess the number combinations (depending on your game settings).</p>
  <app-attempts-list
    [attempts$]="[mockAttempt]"
    [mockAttempt$]="mockAttempt"
    [loading]="false"
    [attemptCounter]="10"
  ></app-attempts-list>
  <p>4. You'll able to see the history of guesses and their feedback.</p>
  <app-attempt-card
    class="attemptList"
    [attempt$]="attempt"
  >
  </app-attempt-card>

  <p>5. Each guess number has its own color.</p>
  <app-feedback-card
    class="feedback"
    [feedbacks$]="mock.feedbacks">
  </app-feedback-card>
  <p>6. Computer will provide one of the following response as feedback:</p>
  <ul class="circle">
    <li>The player had guessed a correct number and its correct location - green square</li>
    <li>The player had guess a correct number - orange square</li>
    <li>The playerâ€™s guess was incorrect - red square</li>
  </ul>
