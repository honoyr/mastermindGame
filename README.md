## 1. Overview

Mastermind Game
============
The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the computer (the code-maker).

### Features:
- Difficulty level - Player able to choose difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard.
- Colored attempt - for better visual perception to guess the numbers.

### Requirements

- The IDE/text editor of your choice, such as  [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm),  [Atom](https://atom.io/),  [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- The package manager  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which typically comes with  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A terminal/console
- A browser of your choice, such as Chrome
- Docker on your machine - [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Architecture

My goal for this project was to write clean modular code. I used component based architecture for that which is common for Angular. Here is the overview of the project code structure.

### Data models
Data models are classes that only contain data and state. GameModel is the main data model of the project.

#### GameModel contains the following variables:
- ```randomNumbers``` hold an array of randomly generated numbers received from ```IntegerGeneratorService``` (which gets the numbers from Random.org API).
- ```attempts``` hold an array of ```Attempt```. ```Attempt``` contains user ```guessNumbers``` and respective ```feedbacks```. Each Attempt is generated by ```GameService```.
- ```mockAttempt``` hold mock data of ```Attempt``` generated by ```GameService```. Use for ```GameView``` as default data to show user. Еhe goal is to improve user experience.
### Services
Services are responsible for the business logic of the game. They contain only static methods. Services don’t hold any data or state which makes them easy to test.

### Component
The component is responsible for maintaining the relationship between data and the view. It doesn’t hold any business logic. Instead, it uses Services to process any user input and make changes to data models.

### UI
The view is bound to data models via two way data binding and is updated automatically when data models get updated.
